# NYTimesSampleApp
A simple app to hit the NY Times Most Popular Articles API and show a list of articles, that shows details when items on the list are tapped (a typical master/detail app). We'll be using the most viewed section of this API. http://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/mostviewed/{section}/{period}.json?apikey= sample-key To test this API, you can use all-sections for the section path component in the URL above and 7 for period (available period values are 1, 7 and 30, which represents how far back, in days, the API returns results for). http://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/mostviewed/all-sections/7.json?apikey= sample-key Developed code should be pushed to GitHub with a clear ReadMe.md explaining how to build and run the code. What we care about: • object oriented programming approach • Good UI approach e.g. MVC, etc. • unit test and code coverage • code to be generic and simple • leverage today's best coding practices • clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the coverage reports can be generated Create a GitHub repository, ensure the name is generic and doesn’t have any company names. Commit your code to the GitHub repository and share the link with us. Only share a link, do not send the actual code files
